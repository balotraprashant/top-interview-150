### Key Observations

Bitwise AND removes the differing bits

- The AND operation of a range [left, right] removes all bits that change between left and right.
- Instead of iterating through all numbers (which is slow), we directly find the common prefix of their binary representation.

Shifting right (>>) helps find the common prefix

- If we keep shifting left and right rightward (>>), their different bits disappear.
- As soon as left and right become equal, we know the common prefix of the result.

Shifting back (<<) restores the result

- Once we find the common prefix, we shift back left (<<) to restore the correct position of the bits.

### Example Walkthrough

Example: left = 26, right = 30

```
26 → 11010  
27 → 11011  
28 → 11100  
29 → 11101  
30 → 11110  
```

Step 1: Shift both numbers right until they are equal.

```
11010  (26)  
11110  (30)  
Shift right once → 1101, 1111
Shift right again → 110, 111
Shift right again → 11, 11 (Now they are equal)
```

Step 2: Shift the result back → 11000 (which is 24)

```
Output: 24
