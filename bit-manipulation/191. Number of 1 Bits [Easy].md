### Using Shift Operator

```
class Solution {
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int result = 0;

        while(n>0) {
            result += n%2;
            n = n >> 1;
        }

        return result;
    }
}

```

```
Step-by-Step Execution
n (Decimal)	    n (Binary)	      n % 2 (Add to Result)	    n >> 1 (Right Shift)	result
13	            1101	          1	                        110	                    1
6	            110	              0	                        11	                    1
3	            11	              1	                        1	                    2
1	            1	              1	                        0 (loop exits)	        3

Final Output:
result = 3 (Number of 1s in 1101 is 3)

ðŸŸ¢ Time Complexity: O(log n) (Iterates log base 2 of n)
ðŸŸ¢ Space Complexity: O(1)
```

### Using AND operator

```
class Solution {
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int result = 0;

        while(n>0) {
            result++;
            n = n & (n-1);
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

```
Step-by-Step Execution
n (Decimal)	       n (Binary)	      n - 1 (Binary)	     n & (n - 1) (New n)	    result
13	               1101	              1100	                 1100	                    1
12	               1100	              1011	                 1000	                    2
8	               1000	              0111	                 0000 (loop exits)	        3

Final Output:
result = 3 (Number of 1s in 1101 is 3)

ðŸŸ¢ Time Complexity: O(k), where k is the number of 1s in n
ðŸŸ¢ Space Complexity: O(1)
```

### Which Approach is Better?

**Time Complexity Comparison**

| Approach              | Complexity          | Explanation                            |
|-----------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------- |
| **Shift (`>>`)**      | `O(log n)`         | Checks every bit, even `0`s             |
| **AND (`n & (n-1)`)** | `O(k)` (`k` = count of `1`s) | Directly jumps between `1`s   |

âœ… The AND approach is generally better since it only processes 1s, making it faster when n has few 1s.
