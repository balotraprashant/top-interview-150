```
public class Solution {
    // you need treat n as an unsigned value
    public int reverseBits(int n) {
        int res = 0;

        for(int i=0; i<32; i++) {
            int bit = (n>>i) & 1;

### Overview of the Function

The function takes a 32-bit unsigned integer n and reverses its bits. The process involves iterating through each bit of n, extracting it, and placing it in the corresponding position in the result.

### Initial Setup

Let's say we have a 32-bit integer n represented in binary as follows:
```
n = 00000000000000000000000000000001  (This is 1 in decimal)
```
### Step-by-Step Breakdown

We will go through each iteration of the loop in the reverseBits function, showing how bits are extracted and placed in the result.

**Initialization:**

res is initialized to 0:
```
res = 00000000000000000000000000000000
```
Loop through each bit (0 to 31):

The loop runs 32 times, once for each bit in the 32-bit integer.

**Iteration Details**

Let's illustrate the first few iterations in detail:

Iteration 0 (i = 0):

Extract the 0th bit:

```
bit = (n >> 0) & 1
bit = (00000000000000000000000000000001 >> 0) & 1
bit = 00000000000000000000000000000001 & 00000000000000000000000000000001
bit = 1
```

Place the extracted bit in the reversed position (31 - 0 = 31):
```
res = res | (bit << (31 - 0))
res = 00000000000000000000000000000000 | (1 << 31)
res = 00000000000000000000000000000000 | 10000000000000000000000000000000
res = 10000000000000000000000000000000
```

Iteration 1 (i = 1):

Extract the 1st bit:

```
bit = (n >> 1) & 1
bit = (00000000000000000000000000000001 >> 1) & 1
bit = 00000000000000000000000000000000 & 00000000000000000000000000000001
bit = 0
```

Place the extracted bit in the reversed position (31 - 1 = 30):

```
res = res | (bit << (31 - 1))
res = 10000000000000000000000000000000 | (0 << 30)
res = 10000000000000000000000000000000 | 00000000000000000000000000000000
res = 10000000000000000000000000000000
```

Iteration 2 (i = 2):

Extract the 2nd bit:

```
bit = (n >> 2) & 1
bit = (00000000000000000000000000000001 >> 2) & 1
bit = 00000000000000000000000000000000 & 00000000000000000000000000000001
bit = 0
```

Place the extracted bit in the reversed position (31 - 2 = 29):

```
res = res | (bit << (31 - 2))
res = 10000000000000000000000000000000 | (0 << 29)
res = 10000000000000000000000000000000 | 00000000000000000000000000000000
res = 10000000000000000000000000000000
```

Iterations 3 to 30:

For each of these iterations, the extracted bit will always be 0 because the original number n has only one 1 bit at position 0. Therefore, res remains unchanged:

```
res = 10000000000000000000000000000000
```

Iteration 31 (i = 31):

Extract the 31st bit:

```
bit = (n >> 31) & 1
bit = (00000000000000000000000000000001 >> 31) & 1
bit = 00000000000000000000000000000000 & 00000000000000000000000000000001
bit = 0
```
