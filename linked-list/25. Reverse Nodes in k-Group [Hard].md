### Brute Force

```

    public ListNode reverseKGroup(ListNode head, int k) {
        ListNode res = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode curr = head;

        int length = 0;
        int count = 0;

        while(curr!=null) {
            curr = curr.next;
            length++;
        }

        curr = res;

            int i=0;
            ListNode temp = null;
            while(i<k && head!=null) {
                ListNode a = new ListNode(head.val);
                a.next = temp;
                temp = a;
                head = head.next;
                i++;

            curr.next = temp;
            while(curr.next!=null) {
                curr = curr.next;
            }
            i=0;

        curr.next = head;

        
        return res.next;
    }
}

### Optimized (Recursive Approach)

```
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseKGroup(ListNode head, int k) {
        int count = k;

        ListNode end = head;
        while(count != 0 && end != null){
            end = end.next;
            count--;
        }
        ListNode prev = null;
        if(count == 0){
            end = reverseKGroup(end, k);
            for(int i = 0; i < k; i++){
                ListNode next = head.next;
                head.next = prev;
                prev = head;
                head = next;
            }
            ListNode cur = prev;
            while (cur.next != null) {
                cur = cur.next;
            }
            cur.next = end;
        } else {
            prev = head;
        }

        return prev;
    }
}
```

The solution uses a recursive approach to reverse nodes in groups of 𝑘 in a singly linked list.

Here's a short explanation:

Steps Explained:

  - **Base Case Check:** The method first checks if there are at least 𝑘 nodes available to reverse by iterating 𝑘 times (count).

    If fewer than 𝑘 nodes remain, the base case is reached, and the remaining nodes are returned as-is (prev = head).

  - **Recursive Reversal:** When 𝑘 nodes are available (count == 0), the recursion is invoked to reverse the next group: end = reverseKGroup(end, k).

  - **In-Place Reversal of Current Group:** The 𝑘 nodes in the current group are reversed iteratively using three pointers (head, prev, next).

  - **Connect the Reversed Groups:** After reversing the current group, its last node is connected to the reversed nodes from subsequent groups (cur.next = end).

  - **Return the New Head:** The method returns the head of the reversed group (prev).

**Key Features:**
  - Recursive Processing: Each group is reversed independently via recursion.
  - Efficient Reversal: Nodes are reversed in-place using three-pointer logic.
  - Automatic Termination: When fewer than 𝑘 nodes remain, the recursion ends naturally, returning the list unchanged.

**Complexity:**

Time Complexity: 𝑂(𝑛)

  - O(n), where 𝑛 is the total number of nodes. Each node is processed once.

Space Complexity: 𝑂(𝑛/𝑘)

  - O(n/k) due to the recursive stack, which depends on the number of groups.
