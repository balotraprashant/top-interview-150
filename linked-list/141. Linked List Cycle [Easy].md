**Intuition**

A cycle in a linked list means a node is revisited during traversal. Using two pointers moving at different speeds allows detecting this efficiently. If thereâ€™s a cycle, the faster pointer ("hare") will eventually meet the slower pointer ("tortoise").

**Approach**

Pointers Initialization:

Start two pointers, fast and slow, at the head of the list.

Traverse the List:

- Move slow one step at a time (slow = slow.next).
- Move fast two steps at a time (fast = fast.next.next).
- If fast meets slow, a cycle is detected.

Cycle Detection:

- If fast or fast.next becomes null, the list does not contain a cycle (it ends).
- Otherwise, the pointers will meet within the cycle.

**Complexity**

Time complexity: O(n)

Space complexity: O(1)
