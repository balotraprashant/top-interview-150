## Approach

◽️ Question
How should we iterate through the input arrays?

My answer is to iterate through from the end. Why?

That's because we have some numbers at index 0, 1 and 2 in nums1. The smallest number is 1 in nums1, the second smallest is 2 in nums1.

the next smallest is 2 in nums2. In that case,

[1,2,2,0,0,0]
temp = 3     
We have to keep 3 with variable or something, because we use 3 later. That is tough a bit right?

But if we start from end, we have kind of available positions which are index 3, 4 and 5 in nums1. We can simply put the numbers without keeping numbers.

We know that nums1 and nums2 are sorted in non-decreasing order. All we have to do is to compare the last numbers in both arrays.

Let's see one by one!

             ↓     r
nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3,
nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3　　　　　　　　　　　
             ↑

r is right position where we should put the next biggest number.
First of all, compare 3 with 6. 6 is bigger than 3. Put 6 at right position and mvoe r and the pointer in nums2 to the next.

     ↓   r
[1,2,3,0,0,6]
[2,5,6]
   ↑
We will speed up.

Compare 3 with 5.

     ↓ r
[1,2,3,0,5,6]
[2,5,6]
   ↑
Compare 3 with 2.

   ↓ r
[1,2,3,3,5,6]
[2,5,6]
 ↑
Compare 2 with 2. Let me put 2 from nums2.

   ↓ r
[1,2,2,3,5,6]
[2,5,6]
↑
Now the pointer for nums2 reached -1 index, so stop iteration. We successfully created [1,2,2,3,5,6].

◽️ Question

One more important question is that how many times do we have to iterate though nums1 and nums2.

...😩

...😅

...😄

My answer is "until the pointer in nums2 reached -1."
