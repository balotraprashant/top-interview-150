                // Early exit if we've already reached or exceeded the last index
                if (currentEnd >= n - 1) break;

**Intuition**: Greedy algorithm by tracking the current window (i.e., the maximum distance you can jump from your current position) and updating the jump count every time we exhaust that window.

**Explanation:**

- Initialize Variables:
   - jumps: Tracks the total number of jumps made.
   - farthest: Tracks the farthest position you can reach from any point.
   - currentEnd: Marks the end of the current jump window.
- Iterate through the array (excluding the last index):

- At each index, update the farthest position you can reach.
- If the current index reaches the end of the current jump window, increment jumps and update the window to the farthest position.
- Break Early:
   - If currentEnd reaches or exceeds the last index, you can exit the loop early.

**Time Complexity:** O(n), as we traverse the array once.

**Space Complexity**: O(1), as no additional space is used beyond a few variables.
